Fundamentals and Core Concepts of React

Tasks
# 0. Create your first React App

Create an empty repository called alx-fe-reactjs

Clone the repository and cd into that directory.

Run the command npm create vite@latest alx-react-app -- --template react where alx-react-app is the name of your react app.

To see what your app looks like, go ahead cd into the alx-react-app directory that will be created and run the command npm install.

Next, run the command npm run dev.

The app will now open in your browser on port 5173. If that doesnâ€™t happen, then just open a browser and type in the address bar localhost:5173 and click enter.
